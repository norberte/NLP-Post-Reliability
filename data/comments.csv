"58","It's sad to see such a *terribly wrong* answer like this get so many upvotes. One should *not* reduce the accessibility of methods or fields, neither access them through Reflection. I have written literally thousands of JUnit/TestNG over many years, and I *never* had to resort to testing `private` methods directly. Occasionally, I had to read a `private` field (through Reflection), but that was about it. I guess some developers (many, apparently) are too lazy to write proper tests (which only call `public` methods), and prefer to cheat by using Reflection."
"59","These should really be wrapped in helper methods so you don't have to repeat that every time (and naturally... there are several frameworks that do that already). Also; you can most definitely set `private static final` variables through reflection. Whether you _should_ or not is another matter."
"60","No I don't think appealing to TDD is a valid criticism here. Why should a unit test intended to cover a private method be excluded from that encapsulation? If TDD is supposed to tell you to make that method public, you're not producing quality code here, instead you're appeasing a logical flaw in the language itself."
"61","Few of these replies and comments appear to have picked on this: the question **could** have been about approaches to legacy code, except that the OP has included the TDD tag. I don't have a huge amount of TDD experience yet, but if you study the &quot;seminal&quot; *Growing Obj-Oriented Software Guided by Tests*, I think it becomes clear: private methods should **result from** refactoring and only from refactoring. By definition refactoring means that the code has passed the relevant tests. So I think the question is why this TDD tag was included."
"62","testing private methods should be done from public members, private members that are not invoked directly or indirectly by public members have no value. Unit testing and TDD is not about directly testing every method written, it is about testing the behavior of the written code compared to the requirements for writing that code."
"63","Most purists fail to acknowledge that there are legitimate cases for this. My case: I am writing a plug-in for a (closed source) commercial product. Writing regular unit tests for *public* methods involves mocking large parts of that product, and there are limits to this approach. Being able to test my *private* methods in the manner described above ensures that 95% of my code has been tested before deployment."
"64","In all the answers and comments that poo-poo testing private methods, no one gave a good reason to conflate modularity and access. I like to break my code into small pieces, where each of these pieces do one thing. This aids readability and maintainability.

"71","It's not a hack, it's officially specified for C# in Section 7.10.3 Boolean logical operators: &quot;The result of x | y is true if either x or y is true. Otherwise, the result is false.&quot; Also see Section 7.11 Conditional logical operators: &quot;The operation x || y corresponds to the operation x | y, except that y is evaluated only if x is false.&quot; which further &quot;legalizes&quot; | as a conditional operator.

"765","&quot;The best way to avoid this type of exception is to always check for null when you did not create the object yourself.&quot; If the caller passes null, but null is not a valid argument for the method, then it's correct to throw the exception back at the caller because it's the caller's fault. *Silently ignoring invalid input and doing nothing in the method* is extremely poor advice because it hides the problem."
"766","I would add a remark about this post explaining that even assignments to primitives can cause NPEs when using autoboxing: `int a=b` can throw an NPE if b is an `Integer`. There are cases where this is confusing to debug."
"767","Is it possible to capture NPE thrown by a webapp from the web browser?like will it show in the view page source from the web browser.."
"768","Yes check if the object equals null before you invoke a method on it or try to access a variable it might have. Some times structuring your code can help avoid null pointer exception. eg when checking an input string with a constant string you should start with the constant string like here: if (&quot;SomeString&quot;.equals(inputString)) {} //even if inputString is null no exception is thrown. So there are a bunch of things that you can do to try to be safe."
"769","Another small addition is to try to use Optional return types if it's not mandatory for our logic to not return values, if we want to force a check in the caller."
"770","An additional way of avoiding `NullPointerException` problems in your code is to use `` and `` annotations. The following [answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2386013/1121237) has more information on this.

"771","Downvoted because it's not true that Java sets a variable to its default value if you declare it within a method. It only does this with instance variables.

"775","Also, I think it's important to clarify that `NullPointerException` is an _unchecked_ _exception_ as opposed to a checked exception.

"776","good explanation but sometimes it's not a good practice to handle this exception by if and else, consider a service that you're providing: it would be better if you let the consumer know that the request causes a null pointer exception.

"778","what about using Null Object Design Pattern ? when it is recommended ?"
"779","General advice to NPEs: On public/package/protected methods, **do always** validate any incoming parameter on `null` and include a developer-friendly message: if (null == someParameter) { throw new NullPointerException(&quot;someParameter is null&quot;);` If `someParameter is a DAO, and I know it **must** be fully persisted when handled over, I also check it's primary key below above general check: `if (someParameter.getSomeId() == null) { throw new NullPointerException(&quot;someParameter.someId is null&quot;);`."
"780","And to make sure, the id is never below one: `if (someParameter.getSomeId() < 1) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;someParameter.someId=&quot;+someParameter.getSomeId()+&quot; is invalid&quot;);` This way, I make sure that my public/package/protected (not private, as this makes unit-testing much harder) are properly invoked."
"781","NullPointerException is thrown when an application attempts to use an object reference that has the null value. These include:&#xA;&#xA;Calling an instance method on the object referred by a null reference.&#xA;Accessing or modifying an instance field of the object referred by a null reference.&#xA;If the reference type is an array type, taking the length of a null reference.&#xA;If the reference type is an array type, accessing or modifying the slots of a null reference.&#xA;If the reference type is a subtype of Throwable, throwing a null reference."
"782","When you access some property of an object on null reference, then NullPointerException is thrown."
"783","One interesting aspect to &quot;prevent&quot; NullPointerExceptions from happening since Java 8 is the Optional<T> class. If misused it does not prevent it but if used correctly it can help enourmously by enforcing checks on places where null may be passed by methods. The idea behind it is that it wraps around the actual object that you are passing and provides an isPresent method to check whether a vaiable is present or not. Although this could be done by an != null check, the advantage is the clarity that if you see that an Optional is returned by a method, you instantly know it can be null."
"784","Downvoted because it is factually incorrect that between declaring the local variable `num` and assigning an `Integer` reference to it, its value would be `null`. In fact, its value is *unassigned*, and trying to use it is a compile-time error. *Instance* variables get initialized to `null` when an object is created, but the above example seems to be about a *local* variable."

"797","Re -chisholm: I am not sure what you are trying to say. CDATA might be more space efficient, but not in a way that should matter, since nobody should be transferring xml data that is not gzipped. After parsing, the memory usage should be the same."

"800","The answer is correct. CDATA sections do not escape content. I disagree whether this is academic though. If you are using XML format to store content in CDATA sections, then you can't store any XML content since it cannot tell the difference between content and markup. For this reason, the design of XML is broken. It fails the fundamental rule of parsing and delimiters: that you can embed delimiters in content with escaping. The design of CDATA breaks this rule. There are plenty other things wrong with XML as well, like how it's entitled to mess with whitespace in content. Use JSON."
"801","My point is that CDATA is useless in XML. It adds no expressiveness (everything you can do with CDATA you can do without it) and it provides an idiom that invites incorrect an fragile patterns: producing XML by string interpolation, and consuming XML without a proper parser. Therefore CDATA must be avoided. Therefore limitations in CDATA are &quot;academic&quot;."

"1037","There is a much better solution for this now in Java8: use an Optional as your return value to represent a nullable value. That way the caller knows that it is an optional value and can use all the methods that Optional provides for handling the value."
"1038","I like the idea of a DO_NOTHING action but nobody seems to mention throwing an IllegalArgumentException. If the argument is invalid this seems like a good response. The method will need to have proper documentation either way. Also  returning a DO_NOTHING action is very similar to Optional. Both have the goal of not returning null. I'm not convinced that Optional is &quot;a much better solution&quot; though."

"1048","The second half of this example basically says do not use Java. While that might be a good idea, sometimes you don't have a choise. And in java, null is a valid value."
"1049","A find method opens up the possibility that it didn't find what we were looking for. A habit that works well for me is to use 2 distinct verbs for functions which can obviously fail: findXXX may fail and as such may return null or better an option, getXXX may only fail by throwing an exception. I've also seen variants such as find vs find_exn or find vs find_opt. One way or the other, as long as the usage is regular this is fine."

"1172","Technically speaking, it's O(n) in time and space. Qualitatively, due the immutability requirement of Strings, it's pretty hard on memory; temporarily there are two copies of the char data in memory, plus the room for the encoded bytes. Assuming some single-byte encoding, it will (temporarily) require 5 bytes of memory for each character in the file. Since the question asks specifically for a String, that's what I show, but if you can work with the CharBuffer returned by &quot;decode&quot;, the memory requirement is much less.

"1205","It's important to note that any techniques that inspect the object's `constructor` method (either with `.toString()` or `.name`) will fail to work if your Javascript has been minified with a tool like uglify, or the Rails asset pipeline. The minification renames the constructor, so you will end up with incorrect class names like `n`. If you're in this scenario, you may want to just **manually** define a `className` property on your objects and use that instead."

"1208","instanceof did it for me. Upvoted Thanks."
"1209","When the constructor is an anonymous function assigned to a var, you can at least use toString() to see the function body. From there, you can search for that function body in the rest of the file."

"1223","All the example proves is that the function is that functionOne is given a name on creation of the scope, whereas functionTwo isn't given a name until the assignment happens. Yes, that is significant, but it doesn't prove anything about parse-time vs run-time."
"1224","The terminology for this phenomenon is known as hoisting."
"1225","The named vs unnamed aspect to this question is also important for profiling/debugging your code. Anonymous functions are inherently difficult to profile, because you get limited feedback as to what function is using up memory. Assigning an anonymous function to a variable does not name the function. There is no rule preventing you from also naming a function expression i.e. -> `var x = function myFunctionsName(){...};` However, I do not know when a function expression pointing to a named function (instead of an anonymous one) gets defined (parse-time vs run-time)."
"1226","Looks like a named function expression is still executed @ parse-time (even if it's called by the function name instead of the variable name)."
"1227",".chez Eugene's answer is more in depth, but without Greg's answer it doesn't make sense."
"1228","Is there any advantage to using `var function` then?"

"1232","I think it is more important to know the scope of theses two; the `function` -> `functionTwo` and the `function expression` -> `functionOne`. The `function` declaration is available before any code is executed, therefore `functionTwo` is accessible throughout it's closure.&#xA;&#xA;While the `function expression` is accessible only when the interpreter reaches that line."
"1233","The edit from April 30th (the final script example in the code block) is a little bereft of detail. From the edit comment it looks like it's intended to illustrate that you can't declare a function within a block in strict mode. If my interpretation is correct, perhaps someone could clarify that?"
"1234","Interesting. [According to this test](http://jsperf.com/run-time-vs-parse-time-functions), the same function declared at parse-time was *87%* slower, run-time yielding exponentially more OPS."

"1275","Don't you worry about creating an instance of an unknown value type? This may have collateral effects."
"1276","If defining custom parameterless constructors on structs is allowed (possibly in C# 6), this would stop being the correct solution."

"1279","Just a note (on this 7 (!) year old answer): using `Activator.CreateInstance` is a magnitude slower than using reflection with `GetConstructor` to store a reference to the constructor function of any value type (to reuse).

"1362","&quot;from elementary school math we know those are equal&quot; - I understand that you are simplifying, but I'm with those who feel like this is *over*simplifying. It's not elementary that `*(10 + (int *)13) != *((int *)10 + 13)`. In other words, there's more going on here than elementary school arithmetic. The commutativity relies critically on the compiler recognizing which operand is a pointer (and to what size of object). To put it another way, `(1 apple + 2 oranges) = (2 oranges + 1 apple)`, but `(1 apple + 2 oranges) != (1 orange + 2 apples)`."

"1368",": No, it's because the *types*, not the values, are the same. Furthermore, elementary school arithmetic cannot be applied blindly to arithmetic operators. Consider `INT_MAX - 5 + 1` vs `INT_MAX + 1 - 5`."
"1369",": Hardly. The type of `a` and the type of `99` are certainly not the same in this question."
"1370",": What is it called when you edit your comment in order to make my response look stupid? You just have to look up a few comments, to see that type DOES matter. `(10 + (int *)13) != ((int *)10 + 13)` and that was already pointed out."
"1371","Also, my claim that &quot;elementary school arithmetic cannot be applied blindly to arithmetic operators&quot; needs only one example to prove that further consideration, not blind application, is necessary. And I can provide several examples. Here's another case where type is important: `T a = 7.0; double x = a / 2.0;` Clearly whether `a` is `int` or `double` makes a huge difference in the answer."
"1372","More examples are possible, due to limited range and precision of floating-point types. The example I chose originally, I chose because it involves integer addition, same as the problem under discussion."

"1382","A little history may help explain why this is the way that it is. As noted here: http://www.gotw.ca/conv/003.htm C and C++ have their origins in BCPL. BCPL used `!` (aka pling) as the indirection operator, and it took two forms, unary and binary. `!a` unary has the same meaning as `*a` does in C/C++, i.e. unary indirection. `a!b` binary is used for array lookup, equivalent to `a[b]` in C. Since binary `!` is commutative in BCPL, and has the same effect as `!(a + b)` I very strongly suspect this is why array indirection has the same commutative behavior in C/C++."

"1384","Why is it syntactically allowed to index integer literals by the standard? I cannot see how anyone would write this intentionally. The standard probably allows it because adding a check will make a compiler parser/lexer slightly more complex. But I think in today's world the speed impact on compilation will be minimal, while catching unintentional behaviour is very useful. Newer versions of GCC even warn about fall-through in switches, which has an actual intentional use. So IMHO compilers should at least warn about this.

"1583","one might want to add that big-O represents an upper bound (given by an algorithm), big-Omega give a lower bound (usually given as a proof independent from a specific algorithm) and big-Theta means that an &quot;optimal&quot; algorithm reaching that lower bound is known."

"1591","My concern is similar to . Big-O is only useful when N is large. When N is small, the prefactor often matters a lot. A good example is with [insertion sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort). Insertion sort is O(N^2), but has very good cache-locality. This makes it faster than many O(N log N) algorithms when the list is small (< 10 elements). Similarly, for small N, lookup in a binary tree is often faster than a hash table. Good hash functions can chew through a good number of cycles, making the prefactor quite significant."

"1601","The use of the word *complexity* in this explanation is worse than misleading.

"1831","It's technically incorrect to say that *&quot;The garbage collector will eventually free all managed objects&quot;.* Actually, the GC is not obligated to run if your program does not experience memory pressure, so it is completely possible with some (valid) GC implementations to leak resources by simply failing to call `Dispose` - even if those objects have finalizers. A finalizer is not even guaranteed to run at program termination; the runtime will try, but some types of leaks may in fact turn out to be permanent. So don't assume that a finalizer will prevent a leak, and always use `using`."
"1832","This is a good answer, but the statement &quot;It needs to be done at some point, otherwise they will never be cleaned up&quot; is false and misleading, as this is what 'finalizers' are for, not `IDisposable`.

So if `t` is 0 the projection falls right on `v`; if it's 1, it's on `w`; if it's 0.5, for example, then it's halfway between. If `t` is less than 0 or greater than 1 it falls on the line past one end or the other of the segment. In that case the distance to the segment will be the distance to the nearer end."

"3419","We're off on a tangent here, but personally i often omit the braces when there's only one line, especially if it's a big if/elseif/elseif structure, for compactness. But when theres an if/else and either branch requires braces, I put it on both for symmetry. I'm not going to worry about someone adding a line and not realizing that he needs to add the braces.

To get 4,5, or 6 equally often from Math.floor(x), which just cuts off the fractional part, you want x to be chosen randomly from an interval that starts at 4 (min) and extends to, but not incl, 7 (max+1). That x interval has a width of (max+1)-min = max-min+1 (there's your answer!) = 3, and chopping off the fractional part of 4.2 or 5.5 or 6.7 leaves you with one of your 3 desired integers, all equally likely."

Yeah, it's not pretty and clean, but neither are most of the other hacks developers need to use on a daily basis to get their site looking nice in all browsers.

"3726","If you do the division with integers though you're going to lose precision. The functions I posted handle this correctly, and in my answer I say how to modify them to use seconds as the unit but still giving high precision."
"3727","Ah I understand what the frequency is for now. That definitely worked, but now the difference is 975 which is way too high. I don't think what you described returns in seconds with precision to microseconds. I think it returns # of microseconds."
"3728","My functions as listed return milliseconds, but I say how to modify the StartCounter() function to return seconds with high precision in the answer."
"3729","Well for example you said to use seconds change the /1000 to just assigning PCFreq to the QueryPerformanceFrequency. When I do that I get numbers in the hundreds so that obviously can't be right."
"3730","I'm also not using Sleep()."
"3731","Try the code sample in my answer, I edited it so if the call to QueryPerformanceFrequency fails then it prints to the screen."
"3732","I don't think it's failing. I've decided I'm just going to stick with milliseconds and round up to 1 millisecond whenever it's 0. The QueryPerformanceCounter is giving very unstable results, i.e the frames are very jumpy and not smooth at all."
"3733","This answer's badly flawed. QueryPerformanceCounter reads a core specific cycle counter register, and if the thread of execution has been rescheduled on another core, two measurements from QueryPerformanceCounter incorporate not only elapsed time, but often a fixed, large and hard to pinpoint delta between the two cores registers. So - this only works reliably as presented if your process is bound to a specific core."
"3734","I'd suggest to point out that the performance counter frequency is treated as a constant. In fact the value obtained for the frequency deviates from the `const` returned by the call to QueryPerformanceFrequency. [Learn more...](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11537483/1504523)"

"3741","ahem, CSRF is just as possible with POST."
"3742"," It's just slightly more difficult, as you'll also have to incorporate XSS to get someone else to send an undesired POST request."
"3743"," Notes, it is very slightly more difficult, but you do not need any kind of XSS. POST requests are being sent all the time all over the place, and dont forget the CSRF can be sourced from *any* website, XSS not included."
"3744","So, something is more secure because to &quot;hack the planet&quot; I need to know to type in `wget --post-data 'action=deleteandid=3' http://example.com/do.php'` instead of simply `wget http://example.com/do.php?action=deleteandid=3'` ? That's not more secure at all. It's virtually the same thing."
"3745","no you have to make somebody else with privileges to type it, as opposed to a GET which will be silently fetched by the browser. considering that every POST form should be protected with verifiable source hash, and there's no such means for a GET link, your point is silly."

"3748","Using POST over GET doesn't prevent any kind of CSRF.

"3749","I cant believe nobody brought this up until I did just now, POST DOES NOT LOG BY DEFAULT, GET DOES LOG, therefor, POST < GET for security. And I mean POST Parameters, sure GET can have them also, but then your talking about very a-typical activity. Sorry about the caps, I didnt mean to scream ;)"
"3750","That's because you're talking about specific software, and not POST vs GET - the server software I'm using doesn't log any requests at all for example, and I would never tell people to use Apache or the like anyway if security (or speed, or ease of use, or ...) is of concern."
"3751","Nobody has mentioned it here, but browsers happily execute GET requests all over injecting code across random domains into clients browser - a script link can be loaded from anywhere ( which is why jsonp could exist and is actively being shunned )&#xA;Thats a fairly large attack surface."

Advanced users may still want to bypass the Facade and wire up the components to their own liking.

"4242","Nice addition for improving readability!"
"4243","You have to use `%1$s` instead of `%1`."
"4244","Hahaha... DR, you are right. Lately I am doing a lot of RegEx in JavaScript so it is kind of mix up. :-p"
"4245","That should be: `String.format(WITH_DELIMITER, &quot;;&quot;);` as format is a static method."
"4246","One complication I just encountered is variable-length delimiters (say `[\\s,]+`) that you want to match completely. The required regexes get even longer, as you need additional negative look{ahead,behind}s to avoid matching them in the middle, eg. `(?<=[\\s,]+)(?![\\s,])|(?<![\\s,])(?=[\\s,]+)`."

"4253","Hi miracle-doh and Kanagavelu Sugumar. You can use `(a|b)` to specify the delimiter. In this case, ';' or '.' would be `(;|\.)`. Notice that dot has to be escaped as it would mean to match everything."
"4254","It's great! However..., this seems not to be able to split by variable length regex. As  said, WITH_DELIMITER core body can not have full regex. JavaScript and Python can do, something like the right link [jsmime parse header](https://github.com/mozilla-comm/jsmime/blob/master/headerparser.js#L414). Does anyone know how to do that?"
"4255","Works very well! Thanks"
"4256","Works great. What I didn't realized immediately, is, that you can specify multiple parameters just with `String.format (WITH_DELIMITER, &quot;[\&quot;?!., ]&quot;)` for example, to split sentences, handle the words (look them up in a dictionary for spell checking, for instance), and put the whole sentence together again. For just a single kind of delimiter, the whole question is not that relevant, or is it? You preserve the number of delimiters, well, that's interesting for CSV-files, for instance, of course. But that is solvable with the empty strings of just using `s.split (&quot;;&quot;)`."
"4257","Hi &quot;user unknown&quot;, this will be useful when your delimiter is not just one str like for example (\r\n?|\n) for new line and you want save those too."
"4258","Exactly what I wanted. I wanted to split a paragraph using space along with other delimiter and wanted the other delimiters to be treated as tokens too. The problem is other delimiters like , or . need not be separated from the word using space. LookAround happened to be what i precisely wanted."

"5068","How do you do `swap` for a derived class?"

"5070",": The immediate motivation is [this problem](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12315771/596781), but I've recently been wondering in general if one can write a swap for a derived class by slicing, provided the base provides a swap."
"5071",": I'd just take the approach you're taking, swapping the base classes before swapping the most derived class."
"5072",": I've come to the conclusion that slicing exists precisely for the purpose of implementing copy constructor, copy assignment and swap functions for derived classes. Swap was added just today as this dawned on me. Does that sound reasonable?"
"5073",": Well, I don't actually see any slicing. It's my understanding that `A::swap(rhs)` is the same as `this->A::swap(rhs)`; if `A::swap` called any virtual functions, for example (it shouldn't), they could be dispatched to the most derived class."
"5074",": Hm, good point; calling the base `swap` doesn't actually slice. But assuming that each class implements its own &quot;standard&quot; swap semantics, it &quot;slice-swaps&quot; only the base part of the object."

"5076"," Your move constructor depends on the default ctor. Does that mean that (since move semantics) it's obligatory for every resource wrapper to have 1) a valid &quot;empty&quot; state and 2) a default ctor that initializes to this state?"

Consider the case of assigning a 700MB `dumb_array` to a 1GB `dumb_aaray` on a machine with a <2GB heap limit. An optimal assignment will realize it already has enough memory allocated and only copy the data into it's already allocated buffer. Your implementation will cause an allocation of another 700MB buffer before the 1GB one is released, causing all 3 to try co-exist in memory at once, which will throw an out-of-memory error needlessly."

"5094","For anyone wondering why to use unqualified swaps: std::swap will generally call a copy constructor (move constructor in C++11+) and two assignment operators, and for classes using the copy-and-swap idiom, each assignment operator will call the class-specific swap function anyway. Therefore, using std::swap would cost twice as much, PLUS the cost of a move or copy constructor. That's not to say copy-and-swap makes std::swap super-slow; std::swap is just suboptimal."
"5095","On tradeoffs: I benchmarked a class like the one above using three versions: An old-style operator with a self-assignment test, a copy-and-swap, and a slightly more manual &quot;copy-and-move&quot; which only swaps resources and move-assigns everything else. For an empty array, copy-and-swap is about 25% faster than the old-style assignment with Clang, but for non-empty arrays or for GCC, the old-style assignment is ~0-12.5% faster. &quot;Copy-and-move&quot; generally shaves a tiny fraction off copy-and-swap times, but it doesn't doesn't benefit from whatever optimization Clang used above.

"5096","I had hoped avoiding the self-assignment test would pay for copy-and-swap's extra operations, but it seems that's not always true (probably due to fast branch prediction). Still, it's close and sometimes wins depending on circumstances, so you don't have to pay much for formulaic correctness and exception safety, at least for this particular class. However, according to Howard Hinnant, the idiom can be up to 8x slower for std::vector, so YMMV."

"5172","Zig Mandel is correct: it should be filled and then stroked. The reason is that if you stroke and then fill then the line width is halved. Try it with a really thick line width (say, 20) and compare a rounded rectangle which is filled with the background colour to a rounded rectangle which is not filled. The line width of the filled one will be half of the line width of the not filled one."

The first instead is an alias for `rake db:drop db:schema:load db:seed`, so it wipes out the whole app database but it **does not update the schema**, and then populates with seed data. So, if you haven't changed anything in your migrations, the first is quicker, the latter is safer."
"5860","Don't use migrate as shown in the answer. It will work on smaller repositories and systems but usually as they grow, as some point a _data_ migration (as opposed to a _schema_ migration) gets included (bad) and an issue arises with the data migration which breaks the migrations ability to be re-run. At that point people usually switch to use `rake db:schema:load` instead. Instead of raging against such migrations placed by the infamous 'former developer' and insisting they be fixed, I now just use the `schema:load` approach and carry on with the rest of my work."

"5932","Hi! As a Homebrew maintainer, I just want to be clear that the supported methods are to use a Homebrew/versions formula or to adapt a formula to install the version that you need. Installing a formula from git history cannot be made to work reliably because the Homebrew ecosystem evolves over time, which is why the versions command was removed. If it works on your dev machine, great, but please don't rely on git manipulations or historic formulas working robustly. Homebrew's stable CLI is the command-line interface."
"5933","One other thing to be aware of is that as of early April, the main formulas are split into a separate repo, so you can no longer do git manipulations at the `/usr/local` root as you could before.

"6420","Fine answer, only that polymorphic base class part looks wrong to me. Why the members are `private`? If `protected` was meant ... then destructor should not be `virtual`. If `public` was meant then do not you fear accidental object slicing with those public operators of base class? Especially copy assignment and move assignment should be `= delete` not `= default`. Typically polymorphic objects are not copyable or movable publicly. When copies are needed there is `virtual clone()`. Smart pointers pointing at objects are typically copied or moved instead."

The reason you don't want to use some other temp `TextPaint` object is because you want to be sure to consider all the same formatting (font size, family, style, etc.) as the text view itself. Borrowing this text paint object seemed to be the most logically solution. I wonder what kind of issues you are having exactly on the newer platforms..."
"6870","What about using TextPaint textPaint = new TextPaint(); textPaint.set(this.getPaint()); to pass the formatting?"
"6871","You could, but I don't quite see the advantage. I am modifying the original text paint directly but I will be adjusting the font size any way so what do you gain from creating another object? Of course, if this solves some issues with 3 or 4, it may be worth looking into."
"6872","Instead of constantly redrawing and measuring the text on a canvas until you find the biggest size that fits, could you just draw it on a canvas with a size that is too big and save it as a .png and then draw the .png to stretch/shrink within in the size you want? You would want an original size that is close or bigger than the final size because shrinking a large image looks better than stretching a small image. Or would that method end up being more work and less efficient than just redrawing and measuring the text until it fits?"
"6873","I believe that would not work for several reasons. Apart from being hard to implement, the resulting image would only be scaling the height since the width is generally determined and this code re-sizes the font until there is no more vertical overflow. Also, when scaling text images, you will most likely find the text to be blurry if the scaling does not happen on an exact pixel boundary. I find the rendering and remeasuring of text to be fast enough for all of my use cases. Have you experienced performance issues?"

"7132","I really like the IB integration over using tags -- particularly with the newer versions of Xcode which integrates IB nicely with he rest of the IDE -- and not having to clutter up my controller with boilerplate textField delegate code is a bonus."
"7133","Tags are easier, but this way is better, and more appropriate to a good OO design"
"7134","I really like this solution, but I am using each text field in separate cell views in a `UITableView`.

Any advice how I can make it work in this scenario?"
"7135"," IB will not allow you to connect outlets between cells. So, IB will be a no-go for this scenario. However, you could just hook up the nextField properties using code. `textField1.nextField = textField2; textField2.nextField = textField3;`, etc"
"7136","Why bother with dispatch_async at all? Won't textFieldShouldReturn only be called from the main thread anyway?"
"7137","If you declare `nextField` as a `UIResponder` then it'll work even if the next control in line is not a text field (e.g. a `UITextView`)."
"7138","To answer my own question: without the dispatch_async, the return key press ends up getting sent to the new field :-("
"7139","I don't know if this is the case in prior versions of IB, but I can verify that in a possible future version of Xcode that some people under NDA may or may not be using, IB will detect outlets declared in categories. So you don't even need to change the class."
"7140","Any chance this answer could be updated for newer versions of xcode and ios?"

"7143",": What do you want to do with the switch statement anyway? E.g. The second `div` has two classes but it would only output `I have class1` as you are using `break`. If you want to output every class an element has, then you can just take the `classN"

"7149"," Kling: one question...at the end of the first line of your updated code, you have a comma instead of a semi-colon - does that declare &quot;classes&quot; as a variable as well without you having to retype &quot;var&quot;? I noticed that the code st"
"7150",": Exactly. You can use one `var` like this if you separate the variable declarations with a comma. But you should put a semicolon at the end of the last declaration. This is often done to make a block of variable declarations more apparent."
"7151","FYI: for svg elements, in browsers such as a safari, className is not a string but an object of type svganimatedstring. Checking the class attribute rather than className is currently the most cross-browser way to check class if you are working with svg elements."

Just when you thought IE9 was good enough to call a &quot;modern browser&quot;, you're back to polyfilling here (which [MDN helpfully provides for IE8 and 9](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList#JavaScript_shim_for_other_implementations))"

"7156",": this is so that searching for `foo` wouldn't match `foobar`."
"7157","Why is there a space before and after `element.className`?"
"7158",": because we also add spaces to `cls` so that we only match full class names. `hasClass(element, 'foo')` should not match for class `foobar`. And if we didn't add spaces to `element.className` we could never match the first or last class name"
"7159","Ah, I see. If the element's classes were `foo bar` and you tested for ` bar ` (since spaces were added) then it wouldn't match. So you add the spaces so that the element's classes become ` foo bar `... Thanks"

"7165","Personally, I went with using a static field. Although using getRunningServices() is a more robust solution, I believe there is in these two solutions a tradeoff between robustness and efficiency/simplicity. If you need to check frequently whether a service is running, looping through potentially 30+ running services is not very ideal. The rare case of a service being destroyed by the system can be handled perhaps by a try/catch block or by using START_STICKY."
"7166","No it isn't the right answer because it's also written in the docs: &quot;Note: this method is only intended for debugging or implementing service management type user interfaces.&quot; It's not meant for control flow!"
"7167","People find it elegant to have to go through all that to check if a server is running?"
"7168","Apparently this does not work with ServiceTestCase when writing Android unit tests. Not sure what works differently. The service never seems to get added. However, you can unit test this functionality with a normal AndroidTestCase and just call getContext().startService(intent);"
"7169"," This is definitely for a service management UI since the question is how to manage (I.E. toggle) a service."
"7170","This code is incorrect/incomplete. It also needs to check for the package name, as currently there is a chance you'll find services from other packages rather than your own."

"7175","This does not work in one particular case. When the app is killed, the service that it had started is also killed. But this function will still return true in the activity's onDestroy() method. So it is not reliable in this scenario."
"7176"," docs are written by humans and sometime deliberately to keep them away. but that's the only way to know if a `Service` is running so you won't start it again and again. Also it is helpful in the case if a user has `Force Stop` your app *intentionally"

"7178","This seems to find services that have been stopped as well as running services. Perhaps `return service.started;` improves upon `return true;`?"

Add to that that now any ActionFilter I use in my application I need to remember to add to the global filters, and I'd argue that this approach could lead to errors of its own. If you can give a concrete example as to how my approach can lead to errors, then I'll admit I'm being thickheaded :)"
"7841","You asked about what the downsides would be: the downsides are decreased maintainability of your code base, but that hardly feels *concrete*. This is something that creeps up on you. I can't say that if you do what you propose to do, you will have a race condition, or the CPU may overheat, or kittens will die. That's not going to happen, but if you don't follow proper design patterns and avoid anti-patterns, your code will rot and four years from now you'll want to rewrite the application from scratch (but your stakeholders won't let you)."
"7842","Fair enough. I will agree with you, that if I'm building an all purpose ActionFilter that may be used across projects, then yes, this can be an anti-pattern, as the default constructor may be called, and if DependencyResolver isn't used, you'd get some weird errors. However 1)your approach still requires registration with the GlobalFilters which can lead to the same issue I've stated above, and 2)What if this action filter isn't uses across applications? What if this action filter is internal? Still as bad?"

"7851","This is by far my favorite approach. I love Mark's blogs - they are always spot on. The only drawback to this approach is that the filter gets evaluated on every action, regardless of if it will be applied. If one was to register 100 such global action attributes, where only one actually applied, would there be a noticeable performance hit? That's a lot of reflection calls checking for the existence of an attribute isn't it? Overall, I think the maintainability and not having to use an IoC to achieve DI outweighs any drawback, but it would be interesting to see in an extreme example."

Here's another discussion that touches on this as well: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/backbonejs/3ZFm-lteN-A. I noticed that in your solution, you're not taking into account the scenario where a nested view gets disposed directly. In such a scenario, the parent view will still hold a reference to the nested view even though the nested view is disposed. I don't know if you need to account for this."
"8043","What if I have functionality that opens and closes the same view. I have a forwards and backwards buttons. If I call dispose it will remove the element from the DOM. Should I keep the view in memory the whole time?"
"8044","dadga1, it depends on your situation. There's nothing wrong with holding on to a view in memory as long as you're managing the lifecycle of your views properly. But I found that as my App gets bigger and bigger, it's much easier to get rid of the views when they're not needed and create new ones when necessary."

"8047","Hi fisherwebdev. You can also use this technique with Backbone.View.extend, but you will need to initialize this.bindings in the BaseView.initialize method. The problem with this is that if your inherited view implements its own initialize method, then it will need to explicitly call BaseView's initialize method. I explained this problem in more detail here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/7736030/188740"
"8048","Many thanks for your quality solution to recreate views. I really appreciate it. Anyways, I am curious regarding your initial explanatory statement: &quot;I always remove and create views because it seems a lot cleaner than re-using them&quot;. Could you elaborate this a bit more? Why do you prefer to recreate and dispose the view over resetting the model?"
"8049","Hi SunnyRed, I updated my answer to better reflect my reason for destroying views. With Backbone, I see no reason to ever reload a page after an app starts, so my single page app has gotten quite large. As users interact with my app, I'm constantly re-rendering different sections of the page (e.g. switching from detail to edit view), so I find it much easier to always create new views, regardless of whether that section was previously rendered or not. Models on the other hand represent business objects, so I would only modify them if the object really changed."
"8050",": does this account for things bound via a Backbone.Events object? http://backbonejs.org/#Events"
"8051",", that is exactly what this is for. However, you need to use the &quot;bindTo&quot; proxy to bind the events instead of binding them directly using the &quot;on&quot; method in the Events object."

Right now is `decodeURI(search).replace(/&quot;/g, '\\&quot;').replace(/and/g, '&quot;,&quot;').replace(/=/g,'&quot;:&quot;')`, and it should be `decodeURI(search.replace(/&quot;/g, '\\&quot;').replace(/and/g, '&quot;,&quot;').replace(/=/g,'&quot;:&quot;'))`. Also I think that `decodeURIComponent()` works better than `decodeURI()` because it decodes special chars like &quot;@&quot; and &quot;$&quot;.

If the size of the smallest dimension of the screen is greater than or equal to 600dp, the value in that folder will be chosen.

"8678"," note the &quot;dp&quot; in the &quot;sw600dp&quot;, this means that this does not compare to real pixels but to density independent pixels. So although S3 has 720px, it still has way less then 600dp."

Independently of the resolution. A sw600dp device has at least 600dp (7&quot; screen). A sw720dp has at least 720dp (10&quot; screens). A phone, like a Nexus S has a smallest width of 320dp and a Nexus 4, a sw384 and a GS5 will have bearly the same (sw360). So this technique works also with modern full HD phones."

"8688","dpi and pixels are not the same. As  explains above, even if you have a 1920x1080 pixel phone as a S4 or S5, it their smallest width will not be 600dp. It will be 360dp (smallest width 1080px, it's in the xxhdpi x3 category. so 1080/3 = 360dp). So the sw600dp will work independently of the actual pixel resolution."

This makes the mapping nearly perfect."

"8862","Thanks. So for what purposes are suffix tree bases solution like this are more suitable? By pattern search I simply mean substring search."
"8863","Whenever tokenization isn't possible, e.g. when searching gene sequences rather than natural language, suffix trees (or better suffix arrays) are an option, esp. when the search pattern is very long. They are also good when it comes to identifying patterns like repeated substrings, or substrings that are squares or palindromes and such like. There are various specialized applications in bioinformatics. However, I don't think the Ukkonen algorithm desribed here is used very much in practice these days; I would guess that most people interested in it are interested for educational reasons."
"8864","Yep. In spite of your more than awesome explanation, I am having great difficulty in understanding how it all works.. :) So say I have to add a search functionality for a text book, say big sized book at that. You should be able to search text inside it just like you can in a PDF document. Here Ukonen's algo won't be a fit one you say?"
"8865","A single book, even if big, is still relatively little content. Also if this is part of a single application run by one user on a single device for individual searches, a search index (Lucene-style or suffix tree) would seem to be overkill. I'd use a direct string search algorithm based on [KMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm). It's quite likely that simply using a string search function from the standard library of your programming language, or linking to something like &quot;grep&quot; would work perfectly."

For starters, `%params%` doesn't get assigned because there's an extra space before the equal sign. Then it looks like there's an extra quote on the end. Is there a purpose for this?"
"9151","On Windows 8.1, using `&quot;/c %~s0 %params%&quot;` doesn't seem to pass arguments. To fix this, double quotes (escaped by another double quote) are needed around the params, like `&quot;/c %~s0 &quot;&quot;%params%&quot;&quot;&quot;`."
"9152","Actually, wait... The above doesn't work as expected... And like I said, it doesn't pass arguments... I'm still looking for a solution (wouldn't mind help here though). The cause is apparently that the quote replacement leads to an empty string for some reason."

One caveat: if you click at the beginning, it'll force at the end.

"9325","Opera was beening reported to work incorrectly sometimes with `selectionStart` and `length` returning smaller number on spaces. That's why I use `10000` or any other big enough number instead of `this.value.length` (tested on IE8 and IE11)"

"9328","What exactly is `this` in the context of your code?"

"9333","I see that... why I thought it would work...? So this means I have to know type of data on each column ahead of time and initialize properly?"
"9334",": `data.frame`'s have typed columns, so yes, if you want to initialize a `data.frame` you must decide the type of the columns..."
"9335","For the sake of completeness this would be good to give a second example with all the possible primitive types that could be assumed to make this answer a solid reference."
"9336",": well, actually `data.frame` is not really restrictive on the &quot;primitivity&quot; of the columns types (for example, you can add a column of dates or even a column containing list of elements). Also, this question is not an absolute reference"
"9337","That's all good and true, the initially specified type is not a limiting contract for any given column but it's still useful for communicating intent and whatever degree of readability it offers. I wound up using your example with some double() columns in my application, which funnily enough was written by another using pretty much the same approach as the Question author's solution. I too wanted to see an easier way to do it without recourse to a throwaway row. Exhaustive coverage may be too much, but a good sampling beyond character seems reasonable too."
"9338",": ok, just edited ;)"
"9339"," how do you specify the number of rows?"
"9340",": the question was about creating an empty data.frame, so when the number of rows is zero...maybe you want to create a data.frame full on NAs... in that case you can use e.g. `data.frame(Doubles=rep(as.double(NA),numberOfRow), Ints=rep("

"9343","Nice one with `as.Date(character())` , thanks."
"9344","how do you append to such a data frame without triggering `data has 0` rows error?"
"9345",": use `rbind` or `DF[nrow(DF)+1,] <- the row to append`"
"9346","I really like the second approach. I tried using it, and it seems to have some problems. As you can see from [THIS](http://cl.ly/image/3z370u0W2U0L) screenshot, it sometimes generates strings that aren't the specified length. I put your `randomString(..)` function in a `for(var i=0;i<50;i++){}` loop that generated 50 random strings, and the last one is three characters long. I also told it to write to the document 50 times like so: `document.write(randomString(8, '#aA!') + &quot;</br>&quot;);`"
"9347"," That might be your browser picking up an unintentional false tag in the output string. Check the output source and see if there are a few wayward <'s and >'s in there causing trouble."
"9348","Well, there is a statistical bug here. `Math.round(Math.random() * (chars.length - 1))` will give half probability for `[0]` and for `[chars.length-1]` than for the rest of characters, as to round to them are needed respectively a number in intervals `[0, 0.5)` and `[chars.length-2+0.5, chars.length-1)` of size 0.5, while the rest of characters need `[index-0.5, index+0.5)` of size 1. The correct indexing function should be: `parseInt(Math.random() * chars.length)` as the upper bound for random() is excluded and `chars.length` will be no reached: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_random.asp"
"9349"," That's a good point but your implementation is bad, your learning reference is one you should never use, and there's a bug in yours too. There's a chance Math.random() returns 1, and in that instance you'll get the upper bound which we don't want"
"9350"," Please give me your references. `Math.random()` will never return 1. It's returning value is in `[0, 1)` that means 0 is included and 1 is excluded. Here are four different and important independent sources: Mozilla: http://goo.gl/BQGZiG ; Micr"
"9351","In the other hand, something positive of your last comment is that `Math.floor` seems to be faster than `parseInt` so that's a good one; but the `%1` is still unnecessary, so `Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length)` will be enough and even statistically uniform. If not, please share a reference that invalidates the ones of Mozilla, Microsoft, w2schools and Stackoverflow I've share. Thanks."
"9352","Ahh your right , I haven't checked the references in years. But yeah I did some perf testing and Math.floor is definitely faster than parseInt, often by a factor of 100 or more. As far as references, w3schools has a really bad track record for accuracy and keeping up with standards changes, as well as a bad history of poor coding practices so I've avoided them like the plague. MDN, MSDN, SO and the like are all great though."
"9353","I took the liberty to fix the statistical bug in the code. Because this is the top result on google for 'random javascript string' its a shame to have a buggy answer."

"9568",".kazemAkhgary Because branch prediction helps in >95% of the cases in real life. The example in this question happens to be that remaining 5%. And even in that 5%, the penalty is minimal compared to not predicting at all and always stalling."
"9569","I'm afraid your proposed optimisation is flawed: `int t = (data[c] - 128) >> 31;` has implementation defined behavior: `data[c]` has `int` type, so `data[c] - 128` will be negative for values less than 128. Right shifting a negative value has implementation defined behavior. You can fix this for 2's complement architectures with a simple expression: `sum += -(data[c] >= 128) and data[c];` for which many compilers will produce code without jumps. Alternatively, given the range of `data[c]`: `sum += -(data[c] >> 7) and data[c];`"

"9571",".kazemAkhgary Short answer is that each core has multiple pipelines. Long answer is that it's a loaded question. Try searching for &quot;superscalar processor&quot;. Modern processors can execute around 4 instructions/cycle."
"9572","On ARM, a (short) conditional is a zero-cost operation, because every instruction has a 4-bit conditional field (allowing for 16 different types of conditions on any instruction), so branching can be completely avoided in many cases. (In this case, just do the comparison, then conditionally accumulate). So on ARM, the runtime will be longer for sorted than for unsorted, because sorting requires extra work."
"9573","Note that this optimization is precisely the cause of Spectre and Meltdown big security vulnerabilities. In short, some operations like caching are not actually rollbacked (for performance reasons), which cause some potentially sensitive data to become readable by other processes."
"9574","Let me clarify one thing about your analogy with trains: train suffers by making a bad choice, because it needs to get back to the branching point on failure (I consider that it's going to be the wrong choice as you see). Does the branch prediction suffer from a bad choice compared to not making any choice and rather waiting? Or is the branch prediction in CPUs beneficial in both cases (making train analogy imprecise)?"

"9716","I edited the question with even more details and results of my experiment with the `CursorLoader` and the `LoaderCallbacks`."

"9719","So to answer your question, no... you shouldn't need to ever refresh the `ListView`'s data. Instead, you (as the client) should assume that data will magically be returned to `onLoadFinished` and update your UI from there. This reduces code complexity by a significant amount... none of the &quot;refreshing your UI&quot; code should be in your `Activity` and/or `Fragment`. That being said, this is based 100% on the assumption that your `Loader` is implemented correctly. If your `Loader` does not know how to respond to content changes correctly, then of course it will not work."

"9722","The &quot;custom&quot; class I was referring to was `CustomForceLoadContentObserver`... it is &quot;custom&quot; in the sense that it doesn't have type `Loader.ForceLoadContentObserver`, which is required if you want your `Loader`'s subclass to be able to register content observers on the cursor and receive notifications when the content is changed."
"9723"," If you see the _original_ question (not the Edit 2), you'll see that I did not use a `CustomForceLoadContentObserver`. I just _re-defined the field_ there since it was not visible :-) . Anyway, I've implemented my loader as an extension of `"

"9756","This answer is very useful because of the tip about `checkValidity()`, but it also has a dangerous error. `checkValidity()` is what triggers native browser error messages, not the clicking of the submit button. If you have an event listener that listens to the clicking of the submit button, you'll trigger it when you do ` $myForm.find(':submit').click()`, which will trigger itself and cause infinite recursion."
"9757","You can have a hidden `submit` button that you can use exclusively to trigger the validation messages. This would remove the dangerous error noted by , wouldn't it?"
"9758","I'm not sure it helps if the `submit` button is hidden. It's having a `submit` event listener that makes it dangerous, whether the `submit` button is visible or not. In any case, clicking 'submit' isn't what triggers the validation, so it's kind of a moot point."
"9759","In my chrome, dd 2015/07, form.checkValidity() by itself does not trigger the gui error messages. $form.submit() and $form.triggerHandler('submit') do not trigger the gui messages ether. A click on a submit button, wether hidden or generated temporary, does trigger the gui. Just make sure ofcourse you don't accidently loop the validation yourself."

"10203","Maybe same problem as Daniel Wallman here: my Android Chrome user agent contains the &quot;OPR&quot; string! `Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 8.0.0; ASUS_Z012D Build/OPR1.170623.026) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/65.0.3325.109 Mobile Safari/537.36`, therefore `isChrome()` returns *false*."
"10204","Thank you  and  for letting us know. I fixed it so Opera checks for `window.opr` is not `undefined`."
"10205","Winner! Works in every browser and avoids cloning input field. But if clear-buttons are inside form, please rename `reset()` to eg. `reset2()`, because at least in Chrome all fields are cleared if it is `reset()`. And add event.preventDefault() after clearing call to prevent submitting. This way: `<button onclick=&quot;reset2($('#file'));event.preventDefault()&quot;>Reset file</button>`. Working example: http://jsfiddle.net/rPaZQ/23/."
"10206",", I've renamed the function to `resetFormElement` and added a note that you should preventDefault() on the button `onclick`."
"10207","Problem is, this at least temporarily makes the document invalid. (Forms can not contain other forms.) Whether it currently works or not, it's free to break any time it wants."
"10208",", of course this is only true if the input element is actually in a form, which it does not have to be."
"10209","IMO this is the best solution. It even works with plugins like ajaxForm. ajaxForm relies on the identity of the object and if it is being replaced the plugin does not work. This should be regarded as the definitive answer."
"10210","In regards to having a form within a form, you could always create a new form element outside of the DOM, or append it to the body if you want, then move the input element to inside that form. Then you would reset that new form, move the input element back to where it was, and remove the additional form element."

"10216","Previous file can be still be accessed by e.value...This doesn't 'really' clear the input field (in IE10)."
"10217","To make this work, I had to change the first two lines so they use jQuery to refer to the clicked element:&#xA;`$(event.target).wrap('<form>').closest('form').get(0).reset();&#xA;$(event.target).unwrap();&#xA;event.stopPropagation();&#xA;event.preventDefault();`"
"10218","Latest Chrome doesn't like it (`get(0)` is undefined), I had to do `.wrap('<form></form>')`, as advised in jQuery doc anyway."

"10220","This is failing for me in IE11 and Edge 20.&#xA;It looks like its causing jquery.validator to bomb due to the brief period nested forms exist."

"10222"," ive gone back to $input.val('') which gave me problems 3 months back when I went to this solution. AT moment the simple solution seems to be working chrome/firefox/edge/ie11/ios safari/android chrome. &#xA;Your suggestion is a good one and not "
"10223","Due to this function was called with jquery selector. Example `reset($('#targetInput'));`. So, to make IE 11 works just add `e.val('');` after the `e.unwrap();` line."

"10238","shadeColor('#000000',100) = #ffffff, shadeColor('#000000',1) = #030303... it looks like you're just multiplying &quot;percent&quot; times 2.55 and adding it to the color which doesn't make sense to me. Also G and B seem to be backwards in both forms."
"10239","Yes, that is what I was trying to describe in my text above. Here, `percent` is the percentage of white you want to add. If you add 255, you will add full white. If `percent` is 100, thats full white (`2.55*100`). This will add white to any color. In order to add white to a color, you need to add even amounts of all colors. Therefore, `shadeColor(&quot;#000000&quot;,1) = &quot;#030303&quot;` ... in english is: &quot;Shade black 1% of the way to white.&quot;. Which makes it slightly less black. It &quot;Lightened&quot; it."

"10241","Nice! Good to see its getting around. Also, interesting to note... the double ternary statement seems to also work in PHP as well."
"10242","I used [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor) -- `tinycolor.darken(color,amount);`"
"10243","TinyColor is cool. No doubt about that. Tons of features, more accurate, uses HSL, list goes on, etc... Its however, not that tiny nor fast (comparatively)."
"10244","best answer ever, wow"
"10245","Great post ... :) ... just created Swift extension of it: https://gist.github.com/matejukmar/1da47f7a950d1ba68a95"
"10246","Here is the PHP version for the updated shadeColor2 version:&#xA;&#xA;`function shadeColor2($color, $percent) {&#xA; &#xA; $color = str_replace(&quot;#&quot;, &quot;&quot;, $color);&#xA; &#xA; $t=$percent<0?0:255;&#xA; $p=$percent<0?$percent*-1:$percent;&#xA; &#xA; $RGB = str_split($color, 2);&#xA; $R=hexdec($RGB[0]);&#xA; $G=hexdec($RGB[1]);&#xA; $B=hexdec($RGB[2]);&#xA; &#xA; return '#'.substr(dechex(0x1000000+(round(($t-$R)*$p)+$R)*0x10000+(round(($t-$G)*$p)+$G)*0x100+(round(($t-$B)*$p)+$B)),1);&#xA; }`"
"10247","I'd like to understand why `shadeColor2(shadeColor2(color, percent), -percent/(percent + 1)) !== color`. Shouldn't the color stay the same if I lighten it by given percent and then darken it by reverse percent?"
"10248","Think of it this way. If I took the number `100` and lowered it by 10% it would be `90`. Then, If I raised `90` by 10% it would be `99`. And In reverse... If I had `100` and raised it by 10% I would have `110` and then if I lowered it by 10%... I would have `99`. I think this trick is used in the financial system to make (steal) money."
"10249","This is why I don't lighten by 10 % and darken by 10 %, but instead use the reverse percentage, which is ~9.09 % for 10 % (e.g., start with `100`, increase it by 10 % to `110`, and then decrease it by 9.09 % back to `100`). However, even with this adjustment, the result is not the original color."
"10250","Sorry, I apparently missed that point. There are maybe two reasons. The first and obvious is that I use Math.Round and you don't get to use decimal numbers for accurate coloring (colors dont have decimals in hex).&#xA;For example, if the Red channel is `8`, add `10%` you get `8.8` which rounds to `9`. Then take `9.09%` away from `9` and you get `8.1819`. Which rounds to `8` so that's a bad example. But it still illustrates that you are taking `9.09%` of `9` and not `8.8`. So there might be some numbers in there that don't round back out exactly the same as my example here."
"10251","Secondly, Its taking a percentage of the distance to white (or black) not a percentage of the `color`. For instance, lets run the math on the Red color channel. With a color of `#08a35c`. (Red = 0x08 or 8 (in decimal)) ==> (255-8 = 247) ==> (247*0.10 = 24.7) ==> (Math.round(24.7) = 25) ==> (25+8 = 33) ==> Red = 33 (without rounding it would be 32.7)&#xA;Then lets reverse it: (Red = 33) ==> (0-33 = -33) ==> (-33 * 0.0909 = -2.9997) ==> (Math.round(-2.9997) = -3) ==> (-3 + 33 = 30) ==> Red = 30"
"10252","As you can see, the percentage is not be taken from the same number. When lightening a color, the `10%` is applied to the distance from current red to white (255-8), so its `10%` of `247`. When darkening a color, the `9.09%` is applied to the distance from red to black (0-33), so its `9.09%` of `-33`. This is where I would assume your seeing the difference. Unfortunately, shading a color up 10% is not as simple as moving an integer up 10%."
"10253","Final thoughts, I am not using HSL here for true coloring. Using HSL is much slower and many many lines long. I don't know how the HSL math works. But you might be able to give 10% and take the reverse to revert back to the exact color using HSL. Try TinyColor as mentioned in a comment above. It does not seem that reverse percentages are usable with my algorithm, seeing that it doesn't apply it to the same number."
"10254","Excellent, thanks for the explanation!"
"10255","No problem. Yes, we were aware that this RGB only method of color shading is not 100% accurate. On my color chart above, you can still notice a change in the hue on darkening shadeColor2 at 90%. Wait, you may have just given me an epiphany."
"10256","the RGB version return something weird when I put rgb(0, 186, 241) as color : `var color = &quot;rgb(0, 186, 241)&quot;; shadeRGBColor(color, -20);` will return rgb(00,-3720186,-4820241)"
"10257","Yes, that is correct. Because the usage has changed from the first `shadeColor` version above compared to all the rest. Only the first version's usage takes percentages as `-20`. As mentioned above, and shown in the usages examples above you need to use `-0.2` for negative 20% when using `shadeRGBColor` or any of the other versions except the first."
"10258"," Thank you man for the hard work :-) note that using variable names with dash like lighter-color will throw an error in javascript `Unexpected token -`"
"10259"," - Thanks! Ya, I didn't even realize I was using a `-` in this answer. oops... EDITED! thx"
"10260","Great answer, unfortunately doesn't support rgba with transparency ie `rgba(15,15,15,0.5)` and also doesn't support 3 digit codes ie `#ccc`  perhaps you could just save the original color, convert it 10% lighter, then just use the stored value?"
"10261"," - Good point! See my new update."
"10262","One of the best answer I ever seen. =D"
"10263","Java/Android version in this question: http://stackoverflow.com/q/32942503/1048340"
"10264","For anyone like me who just want's to use the first (simple) example, add the following to the beginning of the `shadeColor1()` to convert any 3 digit hex codes to 6, so that it processes correctly.&#xA;&#xA;`if (color.length < 7){ color = '#' + color[1] + color[1] + color[2] + color[2] + color[3] + color[3]; }`"
"10265","Yup! Thats also why I marked the `//ErrorCheck` lines with comments in v3. If you delete them... its then essentially the same thing... but with conversions."
"10266","Please note... `shadeColor1` is deprecated. Use `shadeColor2` or `shadeRGBColor` for the two-liner."
"10267"," - Its awesome answer with much more useful information. Missing comma after `f48000` - `var color4 = blend(&quot;#3f83a3&quot;, &quot;#f48000&quot; 0.5);` Just for information. Otherwise information is awesome."
"10268"," - Thanks, Edited!"
"10269","such a legit stackoverflow post."
"10270","Great, detailed answer. If you care to shorten the error checking some, then you can do this: `if (isNaN(p) || p<-1 || p>1 || typeof from!=='string' || (from[0]!=='r' andand from[0]!=='#') || (to andand typeof to!=='string')) return null;`"
"10271","Other micro-ops you can do: (1) `RGB[3] = parseFloat(d[3]) || -1;`, (2) replace the switch block with `if (l===1) return null;`, (3) since we know the data type, use `===` and `!==` instead of `==` and `!=`, respectively (as I have done), (4) in some cases defining too many local variables is more expensive than it's worth, so I would just use `parseInt()` as is instead of assigning it to a variable."
"10272","Correction: `shadeBlendConvert(0.3,&quot;#FFBAA&quot;);` returns &quot;#57fcc4&quot;, not `null`."
"10273","Thanks for your comment and help! Unfortunately, I will be disagreeing with most of what you said here.&#xA;ErrorCheck) `isNaN` has weird behavior. Actually, it doesn't check if `p` is a `number` but rather if its `NaN`, which is, inversely, not exactly the same thing. Check this:[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/isNaN). It even mentions to use my method for &quot;is not `number`&quot;."
"10274","(1) This is technically shorter, yes. not by much. `parseFloat` will return `NaN` not `false` or `null` or `0`; so using it as a `false` is odd at best. This is the case where you would use `isNaN` as suggested to detect this `NaN` as a boolean. But that would add yet another function call. And yours is slower for when there is not an alpha channel. As it has to run `parseFloat` before the condition check to determine that its bad. The code v3, will skip the `parseFloat` all together if there is no alpha channel. And if there is, it runs the same speed as yours. One condition and one function"
"10275","(2) Sorry again, this change is why your `&quot;#FFBAA&quot;` ErrorCheck is not working in your third comment. The existing `switch` statement is needed. `l` is the length. And this in the `else` block which means we are doing hex. So any length `l` above 9 will goto RGB. Which means this &quot;hex&quot; string will have 9 or fewer characters. Well a 9 character hex color is legal, such as `#5567DAF0` with the alpha channel. But 8 characters is not. Your suggestion only checks if this &quot;hex&quot; string is length 1. It misses all the other invalid hex string sizes, like 8, 6, 3, and 2."
"10276","(3) This idea I have gone back and forth on. You mention: since we know the data type to use the `===` and `!==` instead. But those comparators check for data types. As if, we cared. I would think just the opposite here. Because we *do know* that they are the same data type then we don't need to also check it, we can just assume they are always going to be equal, no need for the extra processing and code length. Please stop me if I'm talking out my ass here."
"10277","(4) IMHO, your best point. Yes, the renaming of `parseInt` is not necessary and does slow it down by just a touch. But there are a grand total of 6 local variables declared in that block (not counting the function's parameters but counting this `parseInt` renaming). The `p` and `to` and `h` local variables are recycled, so im not sure their multiple declarations count. This would make it 6 additional local vars. Im not sure thats &quot;too many&quot; but it is something. I did this to compress the code size a touch."
"10278","(2) <Continued> But your insight is correct, point taken. However, this would be the shorter non-`switch` version: &#xA;`if(l==8||l==6||l<4)return null;`.&#xA; I will edit. I used the `switch` because I was hoping it was faster *under the hood* for multi comparisons on the same primitive. But this version only has 3 comparisons. So I'm sure that makes up for it. And saves 27 bytes on the download."
"10279","Thanks for the very detailed and nice answer! Which code snippet should I use if I just want to darken/lighten an rgb color?"
"10280","Any of the ones after the first one. It just depends on which functionality you want. If you dont need ErrorCheck nor 3 Digit Hex decoding. Then just use the one near the top (after the color chart), Version 2 RGB, I will rename and edit to make more clear."
"10281","JVM? I hope you realise you are writing JavaScript not Java."
"10282","Yes, of course. OK JVM, wasn't the right word. Im not sure what they call it.. a plug in? an extension? the JS engine? I thought it was still called a VM of some sort. I guess not."
"10283"," Thank you for library. Really useful"
"10284","missing rgba possibility https://jsfiddle.net/p3wqy9pb/, there are color editors that use rgba instead rgb"
"10285","Works great! But what did you intend by reassigning `h`? The first assignment is lost, right? `var i=...,h=from.length>9,h=typeof(to)==...`"
"10286","This is pretty freakin' awesome! I do have one small problem with it, however: The PHP version seems to have an issue that baffles me.

"10287"," - I see your point. The problem probably lies in that the function name is &quot;rgba&quot; and, while it works fine, this solution only looks for &quot;rgb&quot;. Version 3 does do alpha colors both rgb and hex, just not labeled &quot;rgba&quot;. I"

"10292","<cont.> If `to` is not given, then the `h` is fine by itself. If the `to` is given to us then we check if it is also rgb, if so, then we set `h` to `true` so that the result will be rgb. But if the given `to` color is not rgb it could be either hex or the `c` for conversion. So we check for that. If its not the `c` for conversion then we can set `h` to false for hex. And if it is the `c` for conversion we set `h` to its inverse."

"10363","This is wrong, you should _never_ use `include_directories` over `target_include_directories`. The former sets it recursively for all targets in that directory; whereas the latter sets it for a target.

"10394","Is there any reason for doing `hexdec(bin2hex(` and not just `bindec(`?"

"10396","(btw, we don't really need the `new`) When you do `Array(5)` you're creating an object that kinda looks like this: `{ length: 5, __proto__: Array.prototype }` - try `console.dir( Array(5) )`. Notice that it doesn't have any properties `0`, `1`, `2`, etc. But when you `apply` that unto the `Array` constructor, it's like saying `Array(undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined)`. And you get an object that kinda looks like `{ length: 5, 0: undefined, 1: undefined...}`. `map` works on the properties `0`,`1`, etc. which is why your example doesn't work, but when you use `apply` it does."
"10397","Thanks for the explanation! So `null` as constructor function execution context doesn't really matter there, it could as well be `{}` or `[]`?"
"10398","The first parameter for `.apply` is actually what you want the `this` to be. For these purposes the `this` doesn't matter - we only really care about the parameter spreading &quot;feature&quot; of `.apply` - so it can be any value. I like `null` because it's cheap, you probably don't want to use `{}` or `[]` since you'd be instantiating an object for no reason."

The self closing tag is invalid (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label), and somehow interpreted by the browser as wrapping the select rather than being before it in the DOM (being parent rather than sibling).

"10728","Nt only is this the right way of doing it, it's also considerable more efficent. Here's a quick jsperf script I prepared for all the methods suggested in this question. http://jsperf.com/comparing-arrays2"

"10730","This works great! However, I needed to compare arrays of objects. I used `JSON.stringify(Object)` for the comparison. https://gist.github.com/harmstyler/7896595"
"10731","Nope, even this can be handled. For comparing objects, you need to use `for(var i in object)`. For `{a:1, b:2, c:666}` `i` will become `(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)` in that order."
"10732"," oh, [you're right!](http://jsperf.com/for-loop-effectivity/2)"
"10733","Wouldn't be a bad idea to make this code &quot;strict mode&quot; safe, by changing your first condition to `if (!this || !array)`. It would be a rare but possible case where you'd get a TypeError on `this.length` because the `this` value was set to `null` or `undefined`."
"10734","And would it still have a method `.compare`?"
"10735","I am surprised that there are no native functions to compare array, do I really need to copy paste your code for it to work? It seems something that should just be included in the language."
"10736","I think the problem is, that array comparing implementation may vary depending on what you need. If you just read the comments and other answers, you'll see that my code hardly covers everything that may be understood as array comparing."
"10737","Tom√°≈°Zato good point but I still agree with Pinocchio. Event if it can be understood differently by different people, Evan's solution with the &quot;strict&quot; mode and renaming to .equals is a feature that would improve the overall quality of js scripts, since we can understand that many people don't see the for loops beyond the ones they write. Also, official documentation exists to solve the &quot;many possible interpretations of what a .equals function should do&quot; problem."
"10738","To be honest, this function is damn too slow when you need to compare it quick (for example in mousemove event)..."
"10739","And which is faster?"
"10740","Note that with this code, you wont be able to do `for (var i in myArray) { }` because `equals()` is now a property and the loop will now loop once on this property."

"11266"," See the comments on the question; it's mostly in the key derivation. Basically the process of turning a password into an encryption key is too simple/fast, making it easy to do many attempts. Completely random passwords of sufficient length (usin"

"11269","Ah yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I guess for cases like this where the signals/slots are overloaded I'll just stick with the old syntax :-). Thanks!"
"11270","+1 For a great reply :)"
"11271","I was so excited about the new syntax ... now a cold splash of freezing disappointment."
"11272","In VS2013 the SELECT snipped is giving me `error C2144: syntax error : 'auto' should be preceded by ';'`"
"11273","Ah, removing `constexpr` fixed it. Not sure if that breaks it in other compilers"

"11276","For those wondering (like me): &quot;pmf&quot; stands for &quot;pointer to member function&quot;."
"11277","I personally prefer the `static_cast` ugliness over the old syntax, simply because [the new syntax enables a compile-time check](http://wiki.qt.io/New_Signal_Slot_Syntax) for the existence of the signal/slot where the old syntax would fail at runtime."
"11278","The same error also happens when signal name is not ambiguous but it takes a parameter: for example QDialog::finished. Why is the cast needed in this case?"

"11281","does this mean the cache will last beyond, onDestroy? So that the next time the app is created, it will fetch from the cache?"
"11282","Yes, cache is saved not only in memory but also on disk (see DiskBasedCache class for details). As a quick test, load some data, exit your app, switch off wifi or 3g and enter your app again. You can also specify cache size in mMaxCacheSizeInBytes field."
"11283","Yes, it caches while i'm in the app, but when i quit the app and return into the app, fetching from cache returned null. Hence the question of whether it lives in between activity life cycles."
"11284","Caching on disk works for me, so I can only suggest to double check if you really ignore &quot;Cache-control&quot; header and set CacheEntry.softTtl and CacheEntry.ttl values correctly for some time in future. These are values which make Volley decide if it should check for cache anyway.&#xA;Then you could debug what is being written into cache when your response comes."
"11285","This is useful, however it still just caches the raw response, not the parsed response. So even on cache hits, you must re-parse the response. For non trivial JSON payloads this can add significant load times even for cached responses. As illustrated by the Volley logs:&#xA;&#xA;`(+177 ) [687] cache-hit-parsed`&#xA;&#xA;177ms for re-parsing the response."
"11286",", sure thing it's a quickest solution. Parsed response is a model object, so one would need to use SQLite for this. And that's far more code than rewriting one method."

"11288","mov Can you please tell me how to edit `parseIgnoreCacheHeaders` method, because for me it is not editable right now."
"11289",", I assume you import it with gradle now? You need to download Volley sources from https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley as a library instead and change you `build.gradle` file to include it as a library module. Then you can mak"
"11290","mov Yes, you are right. I am importing with gradle for now. Thanks I will try your solution."
"11291","mov It's working, but there is one problem when using Method.POST with the same URL but not same JsonBody. Volley considered that it's the same response, so whatever i changed the JsonBody i still have the old cache the from first request."

"11293","How would we use this cache with an image loader? I load images with myNetworkImageView.SetImageUrl(). I'd like to have my images cached for a day just like in your example."
"11294","There is no need whatsoever to make changes directly to the library here. It's a static method. I'd recommend creating a separate class to contain this logic in your own project."

So, to write code that depends on element.scope() calls is a bad idea. Don't do this. The answer about creating a custom directive is the right way to do this.  you should update your answer.

But I don't see how these concepts explain the **dot** when *calling* a function. Also, if a function `f` takes a function `g` (anonymous or otherwise) as argument, how would `f` invoke `g`?

"11781","I love this event-driven approach. However I had to use an extra $timeout in the directive-part, otherwise it wouldn't focus on the element, but on the body.

"11784",": If your input string uses a *different* encoding, then you need to specify *that* to the `encoding` parameter; you can test `print d['2'].decode(your_suspected_encoding)` and verify that the correct encoding is being used."
"11785",": But what you should really do is ensure that all strings are Unicode before you feed them to the `json` library, really."

"11788",": the `json.dump()` call by default produces a *byte string*, but your `io.open()` call produces a file object that expects a *unicode string* instead. Set `ensure_ascii=False` if you wanted a Unicode string, *or* don't use `io.open()`, *or* ope"
"11789",": I know that. It just seems to contradict your claim that &quot;If you are writing this to a file, you can use io.open() instead of open() to produce a file object that encodes Unicode values for you as you write&quot;. It is also very odd"
"11790",": why is it odd? The JSON standard clearly states data should be encoded to UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32."
"11791",": and my `io.open()` line **uses `ensure_ascii=False`**."
"11792",": `json.dump([1], io.open(u'1.json', u'w', encoding=u'utf-8'), ensure_ascii=False)` gives the same error. It is odd because it many other parts of standard library has no problem working with unicode stream, and because `json.load` can hand"
"11793",": ah! There seems to be a problem with the library when you do not give it any *text*. You are passing in `[1]` and that's just a list with a number. If you pass in `[u'1']` instead Unicode is produced. This is rather inconsistent and I'd consid"

"11814"," Are you sure you set the `IsBackground` property to `true`?"

"11824","True! Another advantage of the complexity tradeoff is that if you have multiple contentEditable elements, all you have to do is specify a `data-ph` placeholder for each and the same CSS code takes care of all of them."
"11825"," I agree; this is clearer to a reader of the html and easier to templatize."
"11826","This looks good but what's browser support like? Doesn't seem quite right in IE 9 and 10 (placeholder only disappears when typing starts) and doesn't show anything in IE <= 8."
"11827","With IE <= 8, HTML5 is alien speak.....thus the `data-ph` attribute gets ignored.&#xA;You can fix that by swapping it with the `title` attribute.&#xA;As for IE>8, i doubt there's much we can do...but IMHO the behavior you describe doesn't vary much from the 'real deal'"

"11868","The original problem is that when you use recursive directives AngularJS gets into an endless loop. This code breaks this loop by removing the contents during the compile event of the directive, and compiling and re-adding the contents in the link event of the directive."

"12121","Changing font-size to 0 on parent worked for me."
"12122","Since no one really bothered to explain **why** this happens... inline (and inline-block) elements respect whitespace in the markup, so what you're seeing is essentially the **space character** between &quot;words&quot; in the markup. Which is why setting a negative `word-spacing` can also &quot;fix&quot; this, although negative word-spacing and negative margin are invalid solutions because the spacing depends on your browser and your font-size (as demonstrated by Josh's last example), so it's going to be the first thing that breaks if you make any changes."

"12125"," I know that. Did you even read my answer? I said *&quot;however, it doesn't work if the child element's `font-size` is declared using `em` units. I would therefore recommend removing the whitespace from the markup.&quot;*."

"12157","Ok, I've been able to sort it out, you have to set `replace: false`, `terminal: true`, `priority: 1000`; then set the desired attributes in the `compile` function and remove our directive attribute. Finally, in the `post` function returned by `compile`, call `$compile(element)(scope)`. The element will be regularly compiled without the custom directive but with the added attributes. What I was trying to achieve was not to remove the custom directive and handle all of this in one process: this can't be done, it seems. Please refer to the updated plnkr: http://plnkr.co/edit/Q13bUt?p=preview."
"12158","Note that if you need to use the attributes object parameter of the compile or link functions, know that the directive responsible for interpolating attribute values has priority 100, and your directive needs to have a lower priority than this, or else you will only get the string values of the attributes due to the directory being terminal.

"12171","It is important to know that if 'terminal' is set to true, not only the directives with lower priority on the same element will be skipped, but also the directives on the decedent elements will be skipped. This is why double-compiling in the children elements can be prevented."

"12376","Right, I think I understand, but just so I am sure, in my example the `Where` would happen on the thread that is calling `onNext`, which will be the thread the observable is created on, unless I specify a different context in the `SubscribeOn` method. The `SubscribeOn` call must come before the `Where` for this to take effect."
"12377","Actually, I think I am wrong now. In my example, because I dont specify a scheduler, `Observable.Interval` will use a TaskPool thread for onnext"

"12380","So `Where` in your case will call its observers' methods on whatever `stream` calls `Where`'s observer methods. Since you don't tell us what `stream` is, I can't help you with that."
"12381","I'll add a tidbit intended to help those attempting to remember all of this. Paraphrasing a portion of what James said: `SubscribeOn` intercepts calls to `Subscribe`, and `ObserverOn` intercepts calls to the `IObserver<T>`. Both methods cause the respective calls to be made on the specified scheduler."

"12383","Awesome answer. Rx MVP for this alone. A++++, would +1 again."

"12385","It is indeed, thanks Dave - I've added this in."
"12386","Thanks for the answer; could you clarify one point on the sequential ordering of `ObserveOn` and `SubscribeOn` if both are present in the same chain: You say: &quot;...apply [SubscribeOn] at the end of the observable chain, because this is the first observable called when you subscribe.&quot; Does this mean that normally `ObserveOn` will always precede `SubscribeOn`? Does the order matter, and if so, what are the tangible or practical implications of using `ObserveOn(...).SubscribeOn(...)` versus `SubscribeOn(...).ObserveOn(...)`?"
"12387","The significance of my point about `SubscribeOn` is to say that if you have composed of observables `A.B.C` then you would normally prefer `A.B.C.SubscribeOn(x)` to `A.B.SubscribeOn(x).C` - because the goal of subscribe on is usually to prevent a lengthy subscription blocking the thread initiating the subscription to the whole chain so you may as well get off the calling thread as soon as possible. When you apply `SubscribeOn` and `ObserveOn` at the same point in a chain, the order won't have a significant impact since they affect distinct operations and simply pass through the others."
"12388","Obviously, this is a sweeping generalization intended as a guideline, and there will be cases where calling SubscribeOn mid-chain makes sense - perhaps in cases where having access to a specific thread context is important."

"12457","That's because bizzare errors I can potentially get (eg [Cannot remove worktree changes](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2825428/why-should-i-use-core-autocrlf-true-in-git)) and impossibility to have both types of line endings in one project (eg .bat and .sh files) outweight the presence of evident warnings that I can't get anyway in my normal workflow."
"12458","core.autocrlf=true seems the way to go. Is there anyway to turn of the warning message: LF will be replaced by CRLF in... ?"
"12459","As a workaround I'd suggest cloning the repository. That will replace all LFs by CRLFs and the warning will not show up unless the editor adds them again."

I don't understand how, after everything you've outlined, you can come to the conclusion never to use `input`."
"12464"," LF is unix line endings. `input` only converts CRLF to LF, but not the other way round. There's no profit of using `input` if your line endings are already LF."
"12465"," The profit is that `input` will convert my line endings, should I ever *accidentally* have a CRLF somewhere (maybe you once make a quick edit in Notepad instead of your nicely configured IDE!), while not affecting all the intentional LFs."

A person who's responsible for those files is working on Windows, I usually work on Linux, but sometimes on Windows as well. `input` option will convert his crlf's to lf's even every time I commit my changes even if they have nothing to do with those html files. And it will mark all his files as changed in history as well as break his normal workflow. It's a bad practice to automatically inject changes to the files you're not responsible for."
"12471","Thanks for explanation !"
"12472","What if I store my local version in a cloud-based folder (like DropBox) and edit them from Linux in the morning and from Windows in the afternoon? What would be the best value for autocrlf for commiting and pushing my code at night?"

When sub-second precision is not needed, I like `bash -c &quot;exec {BASH_XTRACEFD}>trace.log; set -x; PS4='+\t'; . script.sh` which time stamps every trace line with second precision and without forking to date (low overhead)."

"12778","Uh, I thought it didn't exist, [but I was wrong](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node.parentElement). Anyways, `parentElement` is a rather new property (DOM level 4) and `parentNode` exists since... forever. So `parentNode` also works in older browsers, whereas `parentElement` might not. Of course you could make the same argument for/against `classList`, but it doesn't have a simple alternative, like `parentElement` has. I actually wonder why `parentElement` exists at all, it doesn't seem to add any value over `parentNode`."

"12826","Martijn, could you suggest a way to adapt your solution for the following goal? I'd like to store a list of hook functions in `Decor` and have `Decor.__call__` call each of them before calling the decorated function (e.g. `Victim.sum`). I'll need to update the list of hooks in runtime by saying `Victim.sum.hooks.append(another_func)`. At the same time I'll need to be able to bind `self` argument to the decorated function (e.g. `Victim.sum` should get `Victim` instance as `self` argument). Is it possible to achieve both of these capacities at the same time?"
"12827",": That's fairly easy; I've made the `instance` object being passed into the `__call__` method of your `Decor` object more explicit; you can add any number of extra functions in there, those don't *have* to have `instance` passed into them, but you do "
"12828","Thank you for answering, but the way you suggested, you can't say `v.sum.hooks.append(another_function)`: `v.sum` is a bound method, generated from `mfactory`, not `Decor` callable object. It doesn't allow to access Decor's attributes. In fact, when I was making `Decor` a class, not a function, my purpose was to store the hooks in its attributes. I wanted to have `__get__` return the `Decor` instance itself and seems, that my adaptation of your answer (updated question with it) works. Thanks!"

Thanks for you help, Martijn. I have a feeling, that tinkering with overly sophisticated decorators can make my project fragile and unfriendly for users. I'll at least avoid storing hooks in decorator itself and move them to instance attributes."

In your websockets example, how far back do we go? Should I be trying to create a polyfill to provide support for old versions of Netscape? Or is it reasonable to say that people shouldn't be using IE 8 (and most people aren't) and I'm not going to support the few who still do?"
"12884","thanks for the explanation, how can I add it to my project, there is no npm or bower support,"
"12885","A few people are missing the &quot;why&quot; regarding the mentioned code smell. First, just to get on the same page, code smell is not a problem of itself, it's possibly indicative of a deeper problem -- why and how, here. Why are you browser sniffing? In many cases, to find if a feature is supported. So just check if that feature is supported (e.g. Modernizr). How are you sniffing? Look at the issues people are encountering in the comments with false positives or false negatives. It's not an impossible task, but maybe there's a better way to accomplish what you want i.e. it smells."
"12886","Despite the obvious problems, I continue to have to detect browser - browser vendors intentionally make their browsers behave differently and this causes browser specific bugs. Consider IE with its additional caching (even in the presence of a no-cache header) or chrome with its autoplay policy."

"12893","Just a random query: why does your benchmark include code for setting up the data that is going to be removed inside the benchmarked section? Surely the setup should be done *outside* of the benchmark, but all of your benchmarks call `refreshRange()` (which clones a set of test data into a new node) from within the test. How can you be sure that this isn't skewing the results?"
"12894","Also, why are you using `contents().remove()` in your jquery tests (which builds an internal list of all of the child nodes and then removes them) rather than `empty()` (which just removes them)?"
"12895","Still not a proper benchmark imo. nodes should be generated with attached events, attributes, functions, etc... for a more realistic benchmark. It kind of make sense that removeChild will remove attached resources while innerHTML might not, thus being slower, but if you benchmark without any attached resources it does not make sense."

"12970","true. We should stick with feature detection for this kind of stuff. Modernizr covers most of the edge cases (for example Image Orientation which only works for mobile Safari). I ended up using Modernizr rather than using the User Agent."
"12971","Definitely a good idea to use feature detection, but some behaviors are just hard or nearly impossible to test, for example whether videos on mobile go automatically fullscreen, something that only happens on the iPhone and iPod.

"12981","Holding a reference to whole fragment's rootview is a bad idea IMO. If you are continuously adding several fragments to a backstack and all of them are holding its rootview (which has a quite big memory footprint), then there is high possibility you end up with the OutOfMemoryError since all of the fragments holds rootview reference and GC cant collect it. I think the better approach is to inflate the view all the time (and let Android system handle its view creation/destroying) and onActivityCreated/onViewCreated check if your data is null.

"12985","*Don't do this!* When the Fragment's view hierarchy is created, it contains an internal reference to the Activity that held the fragment at the time.

"12991","Vince, you should seriously just tell others not to use this answer anymore. Even after using the logical paths I suggested, this hack will cause fragments to stay in the FragmentManager after calling FragmentTransaction.remove(hackedFragment) because the inflated viewgroup you're keeping in memory prevents the fragment from being removed (seriously dangerous memory leak). I can confirm this only on API level 22, but I'd down-vote this answer 10 times (killing my own reputation) if I could.

This makes this approach extremely difficult to implement and I will advise against it all the time. Very bad approach. I also don't like the suggestion that Apple has done a better job with this than Google has. Managing fragments is difficult if you don't know how it works. Using other platform approaches (if that is the case) is definitely not helping. Developing for Android requires you to think different."

"12997","This is probably not a good idea. `onCreateView` called sparingly, and only when actually the view is required. Hence, the general idea with the platform is that if the platform calls `onCreateXXX` **CREATE it!**."
"12998","This is absolutely wrong as the onCreateView needs to inflate/create the view in a lot of different situations for example a configuration change. The actual solution to keeping the state of your data is to actually save it in onSaveInstanceState calls and retrieve them through savedInstanceState bundles"
"12999","Another issue that no one has mentioned is transition effects. If you use an animation like sliding a fragment in, during the duration of the animation the rootView has a parent but that parent DOES NOT have the rootView as a child. Trying to remove rootView from the parent will not work. If the user pushes back in the middle of the animation your app will crash with an IllegalStateException."

"13550","ohai, Jarsen. One downside to this approach is that it will not fail if the string isn't a valid double. Instead you will just get 0.0. That is, the result of `- [NSString doubleValue]` is `Double` in swift as apposed to `Double?` (`Optional<Double>`). This is different from the Swift String function `toInt()` which returns `Int?` and states in the docs that it &quot;...accepts strings that match the regular expression &quot;[-+]?[0-9]+&quot; only.&quot;"
"13551","Yes, using `.toInt()` would be better. However, this was more an answer to how to do exactly the same thing, but in Swift."
"13552","This approach tightly couples you to Foundation, and likely won't work on any non-Apple implementations of Swift."

"13571","You might want to add `.lowercaseString` to `String(characters.dropFirst())` as if the user passes an uppercase string it will remain entirely uppercase. Of course this also means that you need to watch out for instances where proper nouns etc require capital letters..."
"13572","FYI: the Swift 3 solution only works on the first character of any string, not the first character of every sentence, so it's kinda useless. Does not capitalize the first word of every sentence like I thought it was."

"13575","Yeah, this was the only solution I could come to as well. However, there are cases where teh Contextual ActionBar happens from the system (for example in a WebView or with an EditText). Those you do not get the callbacks for. So, how would you go about showing/hiding it for that? (Or am I wrong and you can, in fact, get the callbacks for the CAB with those)?"
"13576","Yes, you can [TextView.setCustomSelectionActionModeCallback()](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html#setCustomSelectionActionModeCallback(android.view.ActionMode.Callback)) for that, like Aleksandar described in his answer."

What I suggest is that instead of using that method , in the tableView : cellForRowAtIndexPath method, for the row with the textview on it, if you are in a read only mode set .scrollEnabled to NO, and if you are in an editing view set scroll enabled to YES. This way when just displaying it will always show the full text and when editing it will start with the full text and as you add further text will remain the same size with the earlier text scrolling off the top"

"13781","It has to be that complicated?"
"13782","Just for the record. If you are using fragments you should modify this code a bit. Otherwise you will encounter overlapping problem that was mentioned. First of all you put the code in fragment's `onActivityCreated` method. Then you call `getParent()` twice instead of three times (layouts for `PreferenceActivity` and `PreferenceFragment` are slightly different). Other changes are minor and pretty obvious - because the code is in a fragment you use `getView().findViewById()` and `getActivity().getLayoutInflater()`."
"13783"," - it isn't. Most probably you were using fragments. Look at my comment above."

"13790","Also, structs containing bitfields are padded to the struct alignment, which is based on the bitfield allocation unit. So if this works, the struct will be padded out to 8 bytes anyways and you won't save any space."
"13791",": Please note the last paragraph which addresses this."
"13792","i would add actual compiler may (and probably) apply &quot;data structure padding&quot; so it will not loose efficiency... but you will lose bit, as it is used as the most small fast implementation, witch would probably be 32bit anyway."
"13793","You can force byte packing in most compilers (it's a pragma that varies from compiler to compiler), which makes an array of the struct suitably reduced."
"13794","Maybe you should update your answer so the names in the performance analysis are compatible with earlier declarations. Also, I deduced that the numbers in the performance analysis designate running times (greater=worse); you might want to mention that explicitly. People have expressed concern on padding and packing; you might want to fix your code to reflect this. Also, the link for off-site code doesn't work for me; is it dead already? I'd downvote this answer because of these problems, but I already did it earlier because of padding/packing, so not voting."
"13795",": The concerns about padding/packing are nonexistent. Structures obviously need to be packed correctly if memory usage is of any concern, but that is not particular to this problem. It is addressed in the answer, and respected in the benchmarking"
"13796","Maybe it was not clear from my comment, so I'll say it in other words: you can make your answer better by including relevant code (declarations of `packed40_t` and `bad40_t`). I can guess their declaration, but maybe OP (or any other person) cannot. Also, showing the syntax for `struct` packing is much better than writing that packing is possible. I can guess the syntax, but maybe OP cannot? BTW the link is good - I fixed some access issues at my side. But still, put relevant code in the answer, not in an external site."
"13797","It's odd that bad40_t gives the same performance as uint64_t.&#xA;UNLESS - bad40_t contains just one bitfield and the compiler was smart enough to translate access to that bitfield into access to the full uint64_t struct.&#xA;If that is the case, try adding another bitfield to bad40_t and see if the performance equivalence holds."
"13798",": Getting exactly the same timings with or without. What it does is read a 64-bit integer, and mask out 40 bits using bitwise AND, anyway. Plowing through a gigabyte of data (especially in random order when caches don't help much) is bound by memory"
"13799","Can't you just malloc a big byte-array and just read the numbers as 64bit numbers, but masking them down to 40bit and managing the pointer manually ?"
"13800",": Of course you can, but then you'll have to write even more complicated and ugly (and error-prone) code. The reason why one would want to use bitfields and overloading operator[] with a ref class (same thing that `std::bitset` does, too) is to hide"
"13801","Why didn't you used `#pragma pack(1)` for any of these?"
"13802",": For two reasons: First, pragmas are compiler-dependent, non-portable. Second, the pragma almost certainly wouldn't help here. You can tell the compiler to avoid extra padding such as happens between fundamental types of different sizes, but you "
"13803","On an 8-bit architecture such as AVR or PIC, this would probably be *much* more efficient than attempting to perform 64-bit operations."
"13804","Why did you only use `gcc -O1` instead of `-O2` or `-O3`? At least `-O2` is standard; `-O1` leaves out lots of optimizations. (And BTW, I had a look at the asm for `struct __attribute__((packed)) bad40_t`, which makes it `good40_t`, except that gcc is pretty braindead and does 5 single-byte loads, even inside the loop where it knows it's safe to access the next byte. I'm not sure what gcc is doing for `packed40_t`. It may be branching every iteration instead of unrolling by 8 so it goes away. It's not using movzx byte loads (movzbl), though. I think it's using mov / and."
"13805",": I didn't use `-O1`, I never compile with anything lower than `-O2`. Not sure where you got the idea from that I did use `-O1`, probably because that is what, by pure coincidence, is shown by the godbolt web interface (which I don't care abou"
"13806","Your Godbolt link has `-O`. I assumed (because you didn't say differently) that you included your compile options as well as source, so the asm output reflected what you actually ran. That's half the point of Godbolt instead of Pastebin..."
"13807","You can make a 5-byte struct that compiles about as efficiently as possible (https://godbolt.org/g/vQGzbq) with gcc for separate structs instead of packed into groups with consistent alignment, using `char values[5]` instead of bitfields. I used memcpy to portably do unaligned load/stores into it. (As I said, gcc's bitfield code was horrible for a packed struct; this is much better). It might be worse than using a larger struct to group into a repeating pattern of alignment, though."

For now it may be okay, but if Apple decides to implement that method in the future, there's no way for it for you to call it (i.e. there is no analogous of `super` that points to the primary implementation of a method from a category implementation)."

"14083","So the thunk middleware will defer subscriber notification until `addItemWithNotification` returns? Also, I think I might need to store the return value of `doSomeSideEffect` in redux. Is the recommended practice to just use another action in the thunk to do that?"
"14084","It will invoke the subscribers every time you `dispatch` because thunk may include asynchronous `dispatch`es."
"14085","Then maybe this is the wrong pattern for my case. I don't want subscribers invoked between `dispatch(addItem(id))` and `doSomeSideEffect()`. Would putting `doSomeSideEffect()` in the reducer be an acceptable approach or does it have hidden pitfalls? Also, if notification were deferred until the return from `addItemWithNotification`, how would this be bad in the async case? In an example like the one in the docs, you would still invoke the subscribers after both the network request and the network response (when the promise resolves), right?"

"14091","Thanks! What I was briefly thinking the behavior was is something you could implement by having the middleware pass a special dispatching function that checks a flag on itself to determine whether to notify. The middleware would set this flag to &quot;don't notify,&quot; invoke the thunk with the special dispatch function, manually do a notification, and then set the flag to &quot;notify&quot; so that async uses of the dispatch function would notify normally. But I think the actual behavior is best because it is less likely to surprise people."

"14106","Maybe short way to say Dan's thought is: middleware is centralized approach, this way allow you to keep your components simpler and generalized and control data flow in one place. If you maintain big app you will enjoy it=)"
"14107","I'm probably missing something, but why is it true that &quot;your components know *exactly* that a specific call is async&quot;? Would it not be possible to assume that every call is possibly async and always pass `dispatch` (and `getState`, for that matter)? Not trying to nitpick, but if this is the case, then it's really just a question of dependency injection, and there's no first-order reason that the DI *should* happen in `dispatch` middleware. This was where I was coming from https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/issues/237, in which Dan alluded some of the second-order concerns."
"14108","This discussion is also relevant to other ways to peel the onion: https://github.com/rackt/redux/issues/1182#issuecomment-168795954, with some observations by others on why it might make sense to keep action creators synchronous and pure, other than the mostly aesthetic reasons that have been on my mind. That said, the async action creator approach absolutely seems to be where the momentum is, so more power to Dan in this answer."
"14109","&quot;thunk&quot; approach won't work when you need to show an alert() after the action completion. Promises do. I currently recommend the Promises approach."
"14110"," I don't see why it wouldn't work. It would work exactly the same; put `alert` after `dispatch()`ing the action."
"14111","Why do I need to pass in `dispatch` and `getState`? If the premise of redux is that there is a single global store, why don't I just use that, i.e., call `store.dispatch` whenever I need to dispatch an action?"
"14112","√∏renDebois I don't understand the question. Maybe you can create a new Q for that?"
"14113","Penultimate line in your very first code example: `loadData(this.props.dispatch, this.props.userId); // don't forget to pass dispatch`. Why do I need to pass in dispatch? If by convention there's ever only a single global store, why don't I just do reference that directly and do `store.dispatch` whenever I need to, e.g., in `loadData`?"
"14114","√∏renDebois If your app is client side only that would work. If it's rendered on the server, you'll want to have a different `store` instance for every request so you can't define it beforehand."
"14115","If this isn't in the docs already, it should be. :)"
"14116","I'm curious about 's point: *&quot;Would it not be possible to assume that every call is possibly async and always pass dispatch (and getState, for that matter)?&quot;* But more importantly, it seems it would give us the benefit of using ES7 `async` and `await`. For example, you would dispatch that you're loading, then make a seemingly synchronous call using `await` and then dispatch your results. It's basically the async/await version of  's example. How can we achieve that without manually passing `dispatch`? I can't find any middleware that offers it. Perhaps redux-thunk does already?"
"14117","Some people prefer to use other async primitives rather than functions accepting `getState` and `dispatch`. For example some people use sagas, others use [customized thunks with dependency injection](https://github.com/este/este/blob/be17c7b5a95458e21aacb9782c9ae4797e802ede/src/common/configureStore.js#L27-L32), others use CSP channels, etc. So we don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to do this by default. As for `async`/`await`, it works inside thunks just fine so I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t really see how this is related."
"14118","I agree with  , this was a big pain point for me because I thought I had to use thunks or other middleware."
"14119","Just want to point out that this answer has 139 lines which is 9.92 times more than the source code of redux-thunk which consists of 14 lines:&#xA;https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk/blob/master/src/index.js"
"14120","I just want to point out that `loadSomeData` and `loadOtherData` without `redux-thunk` are called &quot;action creators&quot;, but they return 'Promise'. So I assume when we pass them to dispatcher, they don't reach the reducers, but only produce side effects (dispatch new actions) after some time. So we shouldn't mix them together with standard sync action creators?"
"14121","I think, that there is no need to use such middlewares like redux-thunk if you use binded action creators, but maybe i'm missing something..."
"14122","I didn't understand async redux until reading this answer. (I mean, I understood the technical how, but not the abstract why.) Thanks."
"14123"," how about Saga? which one is better?"
"14124",", I've heard people say that redux-thunk lets you keep everything in one place, but I don't see how that's true. You can keep all of your asyc methods in one file without redux-thunks just fine."

"14126","Async actions seem like such a simple and elegant solution to a common problem. Why isn't support for them baked in to redux without the need for middleware? This answer could then be so much more concise."
"14127"," Because there are many alternative patterns like https://github.com/raisemarketplace/redux-loop or https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga which are just as (if not more) elegant. Redux is a low-level tool. You can build a superset you like and"
"14128","Can you explain this: *consider putting the business logic into the reducers *, does that mean I should dispatch an action, and then determine in the reducer what further actions to dispatch depending on my state? My question is, do I then dispatch other actions directly in my reducer, and if not then where do I dispatch them from?"
"14129","This sentence only applies to synchronous case. For example if you write `if (cond) dispatch({ type: 'A' }) else dispatch({ type: 'B' })` maybe you should just `dispatch({ type: 'C', something: cond })` and choose to ignore the action in reducers instead depending on `action.something` and the current state."

"14155","FWIW, in Swift 3, you can also add `__attribute__((noescape))` to the type of `tryBlock` so that you can call methods on `self` when using it without needing to include `self` explicitly.

This effectively makes the `&quot;Use Legacy Swift Language Version&quot;` to `No` (or if you change it to `2.3` it's `Yes`). The benefit of this option though is every time you `pod install` it sets that setting automatically! Awesome. &#xA;&#xA;I see `SWIFT_VERSION` gets set on **Obj-C** projects as well.

"14252","A few things I want to ask/clarify, please add these points to your answer too: 1) Can you do the same step by step explanation for CASE 1 just so the answer is 1000% complete? 2) Running the plugin with `{ names : ['vendors', 'manifest'] }` is like running it twice, once with `{ name : 'vendors' }` and once with `{ name : 'manifest' }`, correct? 3) When we say &quot;The plugin processes a common chunk&quot; we mean it creates the contents it'll spit in the `bundle.js` file, in memory, correct? 4) Until it's &quot;processed all common chunks&quot; it hasn't written any output to a file at all, it's all in memory"
"14253","5) Considering 2) from above and your explanation &quot;It collects the modules that are used more than 1 time in the other chuncks: as there is no modules used more than 1 time, no module is moved.&quot; this means that the second invocation of the plugin works with the in memory results of the first invocation of the plugin (the `jquery` module has already been removed from the other chunks, so it just finds one instance where the complete `jquery` code exists, that is the contents of the `vendors` chunk), right? 6) &quot;chunks&quot; == in memory, &quot;bundles&quot; == output, right?"
"14254","7) the plugin assigning the final &quot;common&quot; chunk as an `entry` chunk instead of a `normal` one, is, I suppose, default behaviour, right? Thanks so much for your answer"

"14258","I have one more question, if you feel like answering. Let's say that in my example from above, `entry1.js` and `entry2.js` had another common file between them, other than the `jquery` file, let's call it `ownLib.js`. In CASE 2 and CASE 3, `ownLib.js` would end up in the `vendors.bundle.js` correct? How would you make it so that common files other than vendor files are separated into their own chunk, apart from the `vendors` chunk? Sorry for bothering you, but I am still learning how to use webpack"
"14259","Yes that is right: `ownLib.js` would be placed in the first common chunck. If you want to collect common dependencies in another chunck, you have to pass something like this: `{ names : ['common', 'vendors', 'manifest'] }`."
